I've analyzed the sample NACHA file and the documentation. I'll change the credit amount in both payments to 100.00 and update the control records accordingly.

Here's the modified NACHA file:

Changes made:
1. Changed both entry detail amounts from "0000007104" and "0000007205" to "0000010000" (representing $100.00)
2. Updated the batch control record (record type 8):
   - Updated the total credit amount from "0000000143099" to "0000000200000" (representing $2,000.00 total for the two $100.00 payments)
3. Updated the file control record (record type 9):
   - Updated the total credit amount from "0000000143099" to "0000000200000" (representing the same $2,000.00 total)

All other fields in the file have been kept unchanged as requested. The file maintains the NACHA format with 94 characters per line and the original structure.
